# DL/MLExercises

In this repository I will add the projects I did as training. They are not directed correlated as my primary goal is to show my abilities working on different type of datasets.

PROJECTS ON CLASSIFICATION

1. _Indians Diabetes_ is a study to predict the appearance of diabetes depending on some numerical variables;
In this project both Machine Learning and Deep Learning have been used in order to compare the results.

a. For the ML part, the first thing is to extract the relevant features;
b.
c.
d.
e. validatio


For the DL part after the definition of the model to take the first result, a _function_ has been defined to reproduce multiple times the model. 
In this way the the process required to have a solid result has been authomatized and the average of the _n_ models has been taken as the final accuracy.

a. creation of the Sequential model;

Implementation of a fully-connected network structure with three layers; 
Specify the number of neurons or nodes in the layer as the first argument, and specify the activation function using the activation argument.

b. Dense Class, ensuring the _input layer_ has the right number of input features; there have been used 2 hidden layers
c. Output layer has one node and uses the sigmoid activation function.

2. _Occupacy_


PROJECTS ON REGRESSIONS
